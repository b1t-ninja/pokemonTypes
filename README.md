# Pokémon Types
I've created this app because I didn't want to have to remember every type-matchup in Pokémon. 

## Usage
1. Build the app
2. Select the type you want information on (the perspective is what is a viable type to defeat the selected type.
3. The top most type has a 2x effectiveness, the last one 0x.

## Possible future updates
- [ ] Allow multiple type select (for 4x effectiveness consideration)
- [ ] Allow search for pokémon instead of type (simplify the two type selection to just one pokémon selection)
- [ ] Expand to a full "battle-dex" ?
